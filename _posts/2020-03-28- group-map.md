# GroupMap - A Tool for Brainstorming and Group Decision Making

GroupMap is very different from many voting and idea collection tools. GroupMap allows participants to brainstorm, discuss ideas and make decisions. The tool is very flexible and is able to support brainstorming in various domain areas with 60+ templates (grid and mindmap) provided. GroupMap activities can be sequences to include individual submission, idea grouping of submissions from all participants, idea voting and final decision making. GroupMap allows the group perspective to be captures without anybody dominating the conversation. The tool is not free but worth investigating.
