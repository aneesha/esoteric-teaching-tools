# Interactive Fiction with a Twist for Scenario/Problem Based Learning

Tools to build interactive fiction are rarely used to build interactive branching scenarios! I don’t know why? I’ve always found the current set of tools at our disposal to be lacking because variables (or choices made) can’t be shared across screens/branches and custom scripting is often not allowed. I’ve always thought using interactive fiction software would be a better alternative, although I never explored it further until I played an interactive [project decision scenario](https://www.screenface.net/TSF/TSF.html) built with Twine (via Twitter - created by the ASCILITE TELedvisors Special Interest Group, Monash Education Innovation (Monash University) and Charles Darwin University). The scenario involves making key decisions to implement a project while reviewing various project status attributes (i.e. day remaining, budget, project risk and even your reputation).

## What can you do?
- Author Complex Branching/Problem Based Learning Scenarios

  You can download and create multi-pathway scenarios that have branches, variables and conditional logic. The scenario can be exported to HTML.
- Include Media

  Full support for media and styling (i.e. css). Additional functionality via SugarCube library (http://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/)
- Embed complex decision logic

  Javascript is supported.

## To get started:
1. Download for [Mac, Linux or Windows](https://twinery.org/). There is even an online editor.
1. Follow a [simple tutorial](https://opensource.com/article/18/2/twine-gaming) to get started.
