> Tools for teaching in apocalyptic times - the learning remains to be evalauted!

This is a blog of **esoteric teaching and learning tools** that may be of useful when moving to fully online delivery during the #covid19 lockdown.

  * The recommended tools are not for all disciplines.
  * The initial focus will be on programming, data science and maths related areas with a bit of collaborative knowledge sharing, branching scenario/problem based learning and problem solving thrown in.
  * Each blog post will cover a new tool.
  * Comments/suggestions for each tool or additional tools are welcome.
  * No mainstream tools will be included. Enough information is available on tools like Zoom and Skype. There is a broad assumption that a range of different tools are required to create engaging courseware - not just videos and quizzes.


This site is built with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), an easy to use blogging platform with extra features for Jupyter Notebooks.
