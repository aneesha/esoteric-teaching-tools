            "content": "Twine - Interactive Fiction with a Twist for Scenario/Problem Based Learning . Tools to build interactive fiction are rarely used to build interactive branching scenarios! I don’t know why? I’ve always found the current set of tools at our disposal to be lacking because variables (or choices made) can’t be shared across screens/branches and custom scripting is often not allowed. I’ve always thought using interactive fiction software would be a better alternative, although I never explored it further until I played an interactive project decision scenario built with Twine (via Twitter - created by the ASCILITE TELedvisors Special Interest Group, Monash Education Innovation (Monash University) and Charles Darwin University). The scenario involves making key decisions to implement a project while reviewing various project status attributes (i.e. day remaining, budget, project risk and even your reputation). . . What can you do? . Author Complex Branching/Problem Based Learning Scenarios . You can download and create multi-pathway scenarios that have branches, variables and conditional logic. The scenario can be exported to HTML. . | Include Media . Full support for media and styling (i.e. css). Additional functionality via SugarCube library (http://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/) . | Embed complex decision logic . Javascript is supported. . | . To get started: .
